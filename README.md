# Accented Branch

Implementing <b>Node JS</b>, <b>MongoDB</b> and <b>EJS</b> to access and manage data from Portfolio, Clients, Products, etc.

This will transform the website to have dynamic data that will be pulled from a Database that holds information related to Accent IT Services and its products.
Users that use Accent IT Services products, such as APOS, will be able to log in to Accent to view their products, services, analytics, etc.

All in one place. View and manage your own data.

No need for hard coding data that will be likely changed in time. Data from the database can be modified through APIs and/or mobile apps.

Dynamic data will be pulled each time the website is visited so it's up to date.
This works by placing code into the HTML files that will retrieve data and populate the view.
